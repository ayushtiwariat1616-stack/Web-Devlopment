                    Agra, set on the banks of the Yamuna River in Uttar Pradesh, is one of India’s most captivating
                    destinations. World-famous for the Taj Mahal, a symbol of eternal love and a UNESCO World
                    Heritage Site, Agra offers much more than its iconic marble wonder.

                    The city was once the seat of the mighty Mughal Empire, and its legacy still shines through in
                    its stunning forts, palaces, gardens, and tombs. The Agra Fort, with its red sandstone walls,
                    and the elegant Itimad-ud-Daulah’s Tomb (often called the “Baby Taj”) are masterpieces that
                    reflect the grandeur of Mughal architecture
                </li>
                <li>
                    Beyond history, Agra also delights with its vibrant bazaars, where you can shop for exquisite
                    handicrafts, marble inlay work, and colorful textiles. And of course, no visit is complete
                    without tasting the city’s famous Agra Petha – a sweet delicacy loved by visitors.

                    Whether you’re walking through heritage sites, savoring Mughlai cuisine, or capturing the
                    perfect sunrise view of the Taj Mahal, Agra promises an experience that blends romance, history,
                    and culture in unforgettable ways.
