                    Kolkata, fondly called the City of Joy, is a vibrant blend of culture, history, and art. Once the
                    capital of British India, the city still carries its colonial charm through landmarks like the
                    Victoria Memorial, Howrah Bridge, and the elegant architecture of its grand old buildings.

                    But Kolkata’s soul lies in its literature, music, and festivals. Known as India’s cultural capital,
                    the city celebrates the world-famous Durga Puja with unmatched passion, turning every street into a
                    canvas of lights, art, and devotion.

                    A stroll through the bustling lanes of College Street, lined with endless bookstores, or a ride on
                    the iconic trams, offers a nostalgic glimpse into Kolkata’s timeless spirit. Food lovers are in for
                    a treat with the city’s legendary rasgullas, sandesh, and street rolls that make every visit
                    flavorful.

                    From art galleries and coffee houses to vibrant markets and riverside ghats, Kolkata is a city that
                    touches the heart with warmth and creativity.
                    Kolkata isn’t just a destination – it’s an emotion, where every corner tells a story.
